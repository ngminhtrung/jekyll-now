     <p>Hi. Thanks for visiting my personal page. You know, it's not easy to write about outsevles. And I myself have struggle quite a time for the first line of this section.

      Who I am? I was once an electrical and project engineer. In my last job in these roles, I worked for a Swedish factory based in Vietnam, where elephant-size electric products were manufactured (specifically it's transformer of up to 110kV, 80 MVA, less than 100 tons). 

      And then, because of some reasons, I decided to switch to other industry. Now, I'm a Software Engineer, working for a Korean company. My company mainly focuses on AI and Social Network Analysis. So my task is to use JavaScript to build tools for data visualization.
