Many programmers are self-taught.

It’s not rare in the world of software development to come across a programmer who learned how to program on his own.

Some of the best programmers learned programming out of necessity when doing another job, and found they needed to automate some set of common tasks.

That doesn’t mean teaching yourself programming is easy.

There are plenty of eager software developers in training who struggle with teaching themselves and get frustrated along the way.

A self-taught programmer is a unique animal in the world of software development.

I can tell, almost immediately, when I am working with a self-taught programmer versus someone who went to school or coding boot camp.

Self-taught programmers tend to think they can take on just about any challenge.

But… sometimes they get in over their heads or they move too fast, often being labeled as cowboy coders.
